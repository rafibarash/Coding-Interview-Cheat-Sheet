# Coding Interview Cheat Sheet
This cheat sheet covers the basics of what you will see in 
a coding interview. It is a summary of the first data 
structures and algorithms course you would take at college. 
Everyone is encouraged to edit and add info.

## Data Structures
#### ###Bag###
##### What You Need To Know
* A bag is a finite, unordered collection of items that may include duplicates.
* Examples
    * Bag of potato chips
    * Bag of mixed cereal
* Applications
	* Online Shopping Cart
	* Vending Machine
##### Operations and Efficiency
| Name | Description | Big O Analysis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| getCurrentSize()  | Task: Reports the current number of objects in the bag. Input: None.  Output: The number of objects currently in the bag.   | Linked: O(1) all cases Array: O(1) all cases |
| isFull()   | Task: Sees whether the bag is full.  Input: None.  Output: True or false according to whether the bag is full.   | Linked: O(1) all cases Array: O(1) all cases |
| isEmpty()   | Task: Sees whether the bag is empty. Input: None.  Output: True or false according to whether the bag is empty.   | Linked: O(1) all cases Array: O(1) all cases |
| add(newEntry)  | Task: Adds a given object to the bag. Input: newEntry is an object.  Output: True or false according to whether the addition succeeds.   | Linked: O(1) all cases Array: O(1) all cases |
| remove()   | Task: Removes an unspecified object from the bag, if possible. Input: None. Output: Either the removed object, if the removal was successful, or null.   | Linked: O(1) all cases Array: O(1) all cases |
| remove(anEntry)   | Task: Removes an occurrence of a particular object from the bag, if possible. Input: anEntry is an object. Output: True or false according to whether the removal succeeds.   | Linked: O(n) all cases Array: O(n) all cases |
| clear()   | Task: Removes all objects from the bag. Input: None. Output: None.   | Linked: O(1) all casesArray: O(1) all cases |
| getFrequencyOf(anEntry)  | Task: Counts the number of times an object occurs in the bag. Input: anEntry is an object. Output: The integer number of times anEntry occurs in the bag.   | Linked: O(n) all casesArray: O(n) all cases |
| contains(anEntry)  | Task: Tests whether the bag contains a particular object. Input: anEntry is an object. Output: True or false according to whether anEntry occurs in the bag.   | Linked: O(n) all casesArray: O(n) all cases |
| toArray()   | Task: Looks at all objects in the bag. Input: None. Output: A new array of entries currently in the bag.   | Linked: O(n) all casesArray: O(n) all cases |
